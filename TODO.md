# TODO

### MUST-HAVE
- if parser failed, **show the error** (from nearley &larr; it already has well-described problem) instead of throwing
- variables-input && **fun-diff-input**

### LOOKING FOR
- mark function as `A = x`, `B = y`, `C = A * B`, &hellip; (as in `B` task)
    - function-diff input should associate with such names
    - _variables also (?)_
- add nodes right into the graph

### NOT IMPORTANT

- check the output `x - 1` &rarr; `- (x, 1)`. Somehow it prints the excess space after function name
- add +100500 functions (not just those 5 from `B`)
- css &rarr; scss
- add `output` folder with generated js ~~( &amp; css )~~
