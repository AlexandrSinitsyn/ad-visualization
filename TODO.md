# TODO
- add nodes right into the graph (not now)
- add +100500 functions (not just those 5 from `B`)
- if parser failed, show the error (from nearley &larr; it already has well-described problem) instead of throwing
- remove the necessity of spaces between tokens in the input (now it won't parse correctly)
- check the output `x - 1` &rarr; `- (x, 1)`. Somehow it prints the excess space after function name
